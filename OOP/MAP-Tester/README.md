# MAP Tester
A program designed to run a test stand for Manifold Air Pressure (MAP) Sensors. <br> 
For this project, I want to focus more on the Tkinter functionality rather than the actual program functionality.

### Objects
- User
- Main frame (Program)
- All underlying pages

### Tests
I was unable to find a good way to unittest Tkinter objects, so I had to do console tests.
